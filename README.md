# Zine

Dead simple markdown-based zine generator.

## Getting started

### Local development

From the project root, run:

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

This will run a local version, available at:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

There is no auto-update process, so you'll need to refresh the browser to see any changes.
